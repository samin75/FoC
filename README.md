The implementations are separated into 3 segments and in total of 4 MATLAB files, which for question 3, for better separation of concerns, I divided it to two parts. To run each questionâ€™s implementation, one can follow the bellow instructions:
Q1: run HW1Q1.m
Q2: HW1Q2.m
Q3: mcPi_sigfigs.m then answer the prompt of the significant figure
